# DigiSpark_ScreenFlipper 1.0
Flips a Windows 10 device screen orientation using the DigiSpark. 

# How to Use: 

1. Install the Arduino IDE. Duh.

2. Install the Digispark board settings.

3. Install the DigiKeyboard library.

4. Replace "DigiKeyboard.h" with the one provided in the repository.

5. Place the INO file in a proper folder.

6. Set Tools -> Board to "DigiSpark (Default - 16.5mhz)"

7. Compile 

8. Place Digispark in computer.

# Result

The digispark should automatically start flipping the screen, assuming you have the proper hotkeys set up. This script was designed for my school district, where all of our Laptops have this setting on. I might change it once or twice to fix something, or add compatibillity, but not really.
